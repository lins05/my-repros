### Issue Description

ESM files used in a shadow-cljs project have its property-renamed.

Ofc this is fix-able by using an externs file. But that's cumbersome, and ideally
this shall work of the box without any externs files.

### How To

Install JS deps:

```
yarn install 
# or
npm install
# or 
pnpm install
```

Build the release files:

```bash
yarn build-dev
yarn build-release
```


Try to load the compiled code:

Dev mode runs file:
```
$ yarn node -e "require('./output/dev/app.main.js')"

Bark from CJS!
Bark from ESM!
âœ¨  Done in 0.18s.
```

```bash
yarn node -e "require('./output/release/app.main.js')"
```

You'll see errors like this:
```
$ yarn node -e "require('./output/release/app.main.js')"

yarn node v1.22.5
